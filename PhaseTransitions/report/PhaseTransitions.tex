\begin{abstract}
	In this experiment, we explore the properties of the first order metal-insulator transition of VO$_2$ and the second order ferroelectric transition of BaTiO$_3$. We do this by measuring the voltage across these samples as they are heated above and beyond the critical temperatures ($T_C$). We use these experiments to explore and verify important foundations of phase transition theory, such as the Curie-Weiss law, and to compare our data to known values.

\section{Introduction}

Like gravity, phase transition are phenomena which have long been observed, but only recently have they been understood scientifically. The freezing, melting, and evaporation of water has long been central to human life, controlling the availability of food and the need for shelter, but only in the past two centuries has any real effort been put into a scientific understanding of how matter transitions between these phases. The first serious attempt to understand this type of phenomenon was undertaken by Charles Caignard de la Tour in 1822. In his study, he classified the 'solid $\leftrightarrow$ liquid $\leftrightarrow$ gas' phase transitions of alcohol according to the Temperature, Pressure, and Volume at which they occurred \cite{phase_history}. Later, in 1873, Josiah Willard Gibbs built on this work to introduce the concept of the phase diagram\cite{phase_history, gibbs}. With this diagram came the notion that phase transitions could be understood from a purely thermodynamic perspective. And, with the discovery of the ferromagnetic phase transition by Peter Curie in 1895 (along with its formal description by Peter Weiss in 1907), the race was on to find and classify phase transitions in a wide variety of systems. However, it wasn't until the discovery of the phase transition of liquid helium to a superfluid state that a solid classification system was able to take hold. It was observed experimentally that, during this transition, there was no latent heat and no visible boundary between the two phases \cite{phase_history}. Instead, it was found that there was a discontinuity in the second derivative of the free energy of the system, which showed itself in the famous lambda plot of heat capacity vs. temperature (Figure \ref{fig:lambda_point_helium}). This observation spurred Ehrenfest to introduce the first comprehensive classification system for phase transitions. The system was constructed around the 'order' of the discontinuity of the free energy of the system. Classically known phase transitions (water $\leftrightarrow$ ice, etc.) as well as others like the ferromagnetic transition of iron are classified as first order phase transitions, while the newly discovered HeI $\leftrightarrow$ HeII transition is a second order transition \cite{physics_of_phase, manual}. This classification scheme was soon validated, as superconductivity was proven to accompany the helium superfluid transition in the second order category. Landau built on this classification system to create much of the theory of phase transitions we still use today \cite{manual}.

\end{figure}

The two main types of phase transitions, and the only two we concern ourselves with here, are phase transitions of the first and second order. Third and higher order transitions exist, but are much less common than either of the lower orders \cite{thirdorder}. First order transitions, as stated above, are characterized by a discontinuity in the derivative of the free energy. This gives rise to two different functions for the free energy, $F_1$ and $F_2$, above and below the critical temperature $T_C$ \cite{manual, physics_of_phase}. If there were no energy cost to the material switching between the two phases, we would expect to see the phase transition of the entire material occur at exactly $T_C$. However, because the transition between phases often involves a physical rearrangement of the system, there must be some energy cost. Because of this, local energy minima can form (and remain stable for a good deal of time) where the original phase exists even above $T_C$. Extra heat is required to overcome the energy of the kinetic barrier between the regions of differing phases, and so the transition will happen at $T_C + T^*$ \cite{manual}. The same phenomenon occurs when cooling, and the transition will take place at $T_C - T^*$. This will result in a hysteresis curve. We study this first order hysteretic phenomenon in Vanadium Dioxide (VO$_2$), which undergoes a first order Metal-Insulator transition.

Second order transitions, by contrast, have a continuous function of $F$ across all temperature ranges (barring the material being subject to an unrelated first order transition). Thus, from the transition, there is no change in latent heat ($Q = 0$) and $\Delta U = 0$ \cite{manual}. Thus, we have an order parameter which is $0$ at $T_C$ and increases as $T$ moves away from $T_C$. This fact allowed Landau to construct his theory of second order phase transitions by expanding $F(T)$ as a function of the order parameter $m$ in the vicinity of $T_C$ \cite{manual, phase_1}. Omitting odd powers in the expansion due to symmetry considerations \cite{manual}, the expression reads:
\begin{gather}
	\begin{align}
	F\left(T\right) 	& = F_0\left(T\right)+\alpha(T) m^2+\frac{1}{2}\beta(T) m^4 \nonumber \\
	\downarrow 		& ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \frac{d^2F}{dm^2} > 0 \nonumber \\
					& =F_0\left(T\right)+\alpha_0(T - T_C) m^2+\frac{1}{2}\beta_0 m^4 \nonumber
	\end{align}
\end{gather}
In order to find the value of the order parameter corresponding to the phase transition, we wish to minimize this function with respect to $m$. Doing this, we find that:
\begin{gather}
	m = 	\begin{cases}
			0 & T > T_C \\
			\pm \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_0 (TC - T)}{\beta_0}} & T \le T_C
		\end{cases} \nonumber
\end{gather}
Physically, this means that above the critical temperature, there is only one state for the system to be in, which corresponds to $m = 0$. Below the critical temperature, this symmetry is broken into two states, one with $+m$ and one with $-m$, each with its own stable minima of $F(T)$. We will measure this parameter, and relate it to important quantities like succeptability $\chi$ and the Curie-Weiss constant, later in the lab. The second order transition we will be studying is the ferroelectric transition of Barium Titanate (BaTiO$_3$) due to its perovskite crystal structure.

\section{Review of Previous Work}

Phase transitions have long been the subject of intense study, and their importance to solid-state physics and materials science cannot be overstated. Early studies of the phase transitions of alcohol paved the way for thermodynamics as we know it to take shape \cite{phase_history}. More recently, phase transitions have been used successfully in a wide variety of industrial applications.

The superconducting phase transition is the subject of much study, and with good reasons. Superconductors have applications ranging from the construction of magnets \cite{magnets} to the construction of magnetic cloaks \cite{rapheal}, from quantum computers \cite{quantum_super, quantum_super2} to trains \cite{trains} --- the list is endless. And understanding the phase transition of superconductors is the first step in being able to harness their unique abilities. The superconducting transition is of the second order, and much painstaking effort has been taken to understand the theory of the transition exactly (beyond the mean field approach allowed by the Ginzburg-Landau model) \cite{superconductor, supercond2, supercond3}.

The applications of the metal-insulator transition, studied here, is itself far reaching. It has been shown that an ultra-fast electronic switch can be constructed from vanadium dioxide (among other MIT materials) \cite{switching}. Its applications also extend beyond this into computer memory and optical shutters \cite{memory}, as the MIT also changes the transparency of VO$_2$ to infrared light.

Barium Titanate, too, has many applications in electronics. It has long been used in the constuction of capacitors, particularly those where a high dielectric constant is desired ($k \sim 7000$) \cite{capacitors}. Additionally, as we will show in the lab, the capacitance of a BaTiO$_3$ capacitor will drop as it is heated across its critical temperature. This can be useful for systems where a temperature dependent capacitance is desired. Because of its ferroelectric properties, Barium Titanate can also be used in a wide variety of thermal imaging systems, non-linear optics, and other advanced electronic devices \cite{thermals}.

The mathematical underpinnings of phase transitions have also been extended to describe a wide range of phenomena. In the earliest moments of the Universe, cosmologists believe that the cosmos underwent a period of superluminal inflation \cite{cosmo}. The cause of this inflationary period has been theorized to be a phase transition brought about by fluctuations in the Higgs field \cite{cosmo2, cosmo3, cosmo4, cosmo5}. Thus, the mathematical underpinnings we discuss here have wide ranging applications throughout the natural sciences.

\section{Experimental Setup}

Our experimental setup consists of three main components: the lock-in amplifier, the sample chamber, and (during the resistance measurements) the limiting resistor. Depending on the quantity being measured, resistance or capacitance, the system is set up in one of two different ways.

\subsection{Resistance Measurements}

For the resistance measurements,

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Parasitic Capacitance of BNC Cables}

\subsection{Preparation of Samples}

In the course of this lab, we will make use of two different sample materials: Vanadium Dioxide (VO$_2$) and Barium Titanate (BaTiO$_3$). The Vanadium samples consist of a thin layer of VO$_2$ ($\sim 100~nm$) deposited on a silicon substrate. These Vanadium samples are pre-mounted on their electrical contacts, but we have prepared a Barium sample for our own use. Our goal with the Barium sample is to construct a parallel plate capacitor using silver paint on either side of a flat sample. In order to maximize the capacitance, in accordance with the known relation $C = \epsilon A/d$ where $\epsilon = k \epsilon_0$, we want to maximize the surface area of our sample and minimize its thickness. To that end, we chose the largest piece of Barium Titanate available and carved it down. We began by scraping thick layers of material off with a x-acto knife, and when the sample became sufficiently thin we switched to sandpaper to smooth the surface.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Preparation of the Barium Titanate sample. Subfigures \ref{fig:sample:area} and \ref{fig:sample:thickness} show the images used to measure the thickness and the area of the sample. Subfigures \ref{fig:sample:final} and \ref{fig:sample:inplace} show the final sample, with the electrical connections attached by silver paint.}
	\label{fig:sample}
\end{figure}

Because we chose to maximize the area rather than creating a uniform geometric shape, whose area would have been simple to measure, we performed an indirect measurement of the area. Using a cell phone camera, we took an image with the sample and a ruler at the same distance. We used the photo editing tool GIMP to determine the surface area and thickness of the sample in pixels ($px$). We also measured the length of a section of the ruler to determine the $px$ to $mm$ conversion factor. From these measurements, we found that the area and thickness of the sample were:
\begin{gather}
	A_{sample} = 77.464 \pm 1.5470*10^{-2} ~mm^2  \nonumber \\
	d_{sample} = 1.8592 \pm 1.7820*10^{-3} ~mm	 \nonumber
\end{gather}
These values are consistent with our rough approximations taken during the lab period. From these we find that our equation for the capacitance of this sample is:
\begin{gather}
	\begin{align}
		C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d} & = k \epsilon_0 \frac{77.464 \pm 1.5470*10^{-2} ~mm^2}{1.8592 \pm 1.7820*10^{-3} ~mm} \nonumber \\
		& = k*(3.2384*10^{-13} \pm 3.1902*10^{-16})~F \nonumber \\
		& = k*(0.32384 \pm 3.1902*10^{-4})~pF \nonumber
	\end{align}
\end{gather}
where k is the relative dielectric permeability of the sample.

\section{Validation of the $\chi^2$ Minimization in ROOT} \label{section:root}
For this experiment, we used ROOT, a c++ based data analysis software, to plot and fit functions to our data. To verify that ROOT calculates a correct value for $\chi^{2}$, we performed a hand calculation cross check with a simple set of data. The data set we used for this cross check was $\{ (11.0 \pm 0.0, 23.0 \pm 0.5), (14.0 \pm 0.0, 25.0 \pm 0.5), (20.0 \pm 0.0, 35.0 \pm 0.5), (25.0 \pm 0.0, 39.0 \pm 0.5) \}$. We plotted this data and fit it to a linear function $f(x) = [0] + [1]*x$. This plot is shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:rootproof}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{rootproof.png}
	\caption{Sample Data Fitted to a Line}
	\label{Fig:rootproof}
\end{figure}
The function obtained from this fit was $f(x) = 9.11111 + 1.22222x$ with a chi-squared of $\chi ^{2} = 16.8889$. We then performed a hand calculation of the $\chi ^{2}$ using Eq.~\ref{eq:chisq}.
\begin{gather}\label{eq:chisq}
\chi ^{2} = \sum \frac{(f(x_i) - y_i)^{2}}{\sigma_i^2}
\end{gather}
When performing this hand calculation we also obtained a value of $\chi ^{2} = 16.8889$, verifying ROOT's ability to calculate $\chi ^{2}$.
\begin{align*}
\chi ^{2} =& \frac{(f(11.0) - 23.0)^{2}}{(0.5)^2} + \frac{(f(14.0) - 25.0)^{2}}{(0.5)^2} \\
&+ \frac{(f(20.0) - 35.0)^2}{(0.5)^2} + \frac{(f(25.0) - 39.0)^{2}}{(0.5)^2} \\
&= 16.8889
\end{align*}
