\begin{abstract}
	In this experiment, we test the classical Thompson Formula (Eq. \ref{eq:thompson}) against the Klein-Nishina Formula (Eq. \ref{eq:kn}), its quantum mechanical counterpart. At small angles, the two formulae agree quite well, but at large $\theta$ we see a significant deviation. In order to accomplish this, we look at Compton Scattering of $\gamma$-ray photons produced from the decay of a $^{137}$Cs source. We measure the angular dependence of the scattering probability $d\sigma / d\Omega$ in Aluminum at multiple angles ranging from $0^\circ - 110^\circ$ using a NaI(Tl) scintillating detector. We will also use this phenomenon to measure the mass of the electron and compare the number of free electrons in two different media: Copper and Aluminum.

\section{Background and Review of Previous Work}

In the early 1920s, A. H. Compton, discovered something peculiar in his study of X-ray scattering. He found that the frequency (and thus the energy) of X-rays decreased after scattering off free electrons in a medium. This result is not consistent with the classical electromagnetic theory of light, as the magnitude of the electromagnetic field cannot be altered by the change in direction implicit in the scattering process. However, by considering the concept of light quanta (photons), Compton was able to build a model of the interaction between the incident photons and electrons using conservation of energy and momentum. In particular, he derived a form of the following relation:
\begin{gather}\label{eq:energy_scatter}
	E_\gamma ' = \frac{E_\gamma}{1 + \frac{E_\gamma}{m_e c^2} (1 - \cos{\theta})}
\end{gather}
This relates the incident energy of the photon with its final energy and the scattering angle. This relation, once shown experimentally to be true, was seen as major evidence in favor of the theory of light quanta. Through its derivation (see Appendix \ref{section:derivation}), it also provides a direct link between the wavelength and momentum of such quanta. Thus experiments which validate the formula also implicitly validate this crucial relation.

Another facet of Compton's work with X-rays is his examination of the scattering angle. He found that the theoretical scattering probability (which he expressed in terms of $I/I_0$ and we look at as $d\sigma / d\Omega$) was inconsistent with the Thompson prediction:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:thompson}
	\frac{d \sigma}{d \Omega}_{Th} = \frac{r_0^2}{2}(1+\cos^2{\theta})
\end{equation}
Instead he found that, once again, classical theory was inadequate for describing these quantum phenomena. At low angles, it agrees relatively well, but it fails as the angle of the detector relative to the source increases. It wasn't until 1928 that Klein and Nishina, using quantum electrodynamics, derived a formula which included not only quantum effects but also relativistic corrections\cite{kn_paper_original, eisberg}:
\begin{gather}
	\frac{d \sigma}{d \Omega}_{KN} = \frac{r_0^2}{2} \frac{1 + \cos^2{\theta}}{[1 + \gamma(1 - \cos{\theta})]^2} \nonumber * ~~~~~~~~~~~~ \\
	\left[ 1 + \frac{\gamma^2(1 - \cos{\theta})^2}{(1 + \cos^2{\theta})(1+ \gamma(1 - \cos{\theta}))}\right] 
	\label{eq:kn}
\end{gather}
where $\gamma = h\nu / m_e c^2$. Looking at these formulae, we can see that when $\gamma \ll 1$ Klein-Nishina will converge to the classical Thompson formula. This approximation holds for extremely low energy photons, from radio up to the visible spectrum, but fails as one reaches x-rays and $\gamma$-rays. A comparison of the angular dependence of these two equations for out setup can be seen in Figure \ref{KN_vs_Thompson_Theory}.

This particular experiment, and its results, are well documented in literature. Milissinos\cite{milissinos} describes a procedure for determining $d\sigma / d\Omega$ which is nearly identical to ours, and which was performed in 1962. This same investigation of $d\sigma / d\Omega$ has since been verified many times over \cite{angle_1, angle_2, angle_3}. The implications for physics are profound. It proves that light is primarily a quantum phenomenon, and cannot be completely explained by classical mechanics, as Thompson Scattering attempts to do.

The technique for measuring the electron mass is also well documented, and has been repeated with some alterations by students all over the world \cite{emass_1, emass_2, emass_3}. But the basic underlying truth of the experiment is unchanged:

\section{Experimental Setup}

The source of the $\gamma$-rays for this experiment is a $^{137}$Cs sample, measured to emit $300~\mu Ci$ of radiation in 1978 and now emitting only $116~\mu Ci$ due to its decay, completely encased in lead save for a small aperture. This aperture is in line with the $0^\circ$ line on our table. On the other end of this experiment we have a movable detector. This detector consists of a NaI(Tl) scintillating crystal permanently bonded to a photomultiplier and a pre-amplifier. This detector is mounted on a movable platform which pivots around a point on the $0^\circ$ axis. Marks on the table allow us to rotate the detector semi-precisely about this axis to arbitrary angles. Also on this pivot is a mounting point for our scatterers, which consist of Aluminum and Copper cylinders with a hole drilled directly in the center. With the scatterer in place, the $\gamma$-rays which are emitted by the $^{137}$Cs pass through the aperture, scatter off electrons in the Al or Cu cylinders, and then pass into the NaI(Tl) crystal. These $\gamma$-rays produce scintillation photons proportional to their energy in the NaI(Tl) scintillation crystal. These scintillation photons are picked up as an electric signal by the photomultiplier, and then through two levels of amplification before being output to the Multi-Channel Analyzer (MCA). The MCA reconstructs the energy of the incident $\gamma$-rays from the signals and plots a histogram of Numbers of Photons detected vs. Bin Number (where the Bin Number corresponds to an photon energy). From there, the information is saved in a format which can be read into our data analysis software, ROOT. A diagram of this setup can be seen in Figure \ref{Setup} below:

\section{Measurements}

\subsection{Calibration of Detector Energy Scale}
Before the gamma ray scattering from $^{137}Cs$ can be analyzed an energy calibration of the MCA program is required. This is done through analysis of the histograms generated by the data provided by the program. As previously mentioned, the MCA program stores a count of the events in each channel which can be plotted as a histogram. The peaks on such a histogram indicate the more frequent energies of photons emitted by the source. These peaks can be fit to a Gaussian function (sometimes with a background function) to find the mean value of the peak and a standard deviation. For many different sources, the mean value of these peaks can be identified as an energy value known to be characteristic of the spectrum of the source. As an example, the peak of the $^{137}Cs$ spectrum fitted in Fig.\ref{Fig:CsUncalib} is associated with an energy value of 661.6 keV. Fig.\ref{Fig:Na511Fit} demonstrates another example, with a fit of the 511 keV peak associated with electron-positron annihilation.

\end{figure}

	\caption{Fit of 511 keV Peak on $^{22}Na$ Spectrum using Gaussian Function and a Background Exponential Decay}
	\label{Fig:Na511Fit}
\end{figure}

An energy calibration can be determined by plotting several energy vs channel points from different sources on a graph and fitting the graph to some function. Fig.\ref{Fig:EvBin} shows the plot generated for this experiment.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering	
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{BinvEnergy.png}
	\caption{Energy vs Bin Calibration Plot}
	\label{Fig:EvBin}
\end{figure}

The fit on the calibration plot in Fig.\ref{Fig:EvBin} is a quadratic fit of the form:
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = [0] + [1]*x + [2]*x^{2}
\end{equation*}
In an ideal setup, the detector and electronics would yield a linear relationship between channel number ($n$) and energy ($E$), but due to small non-linearities in the electronics of this setup, this relationship turns out to be quadratic with an exact formula of:

\begin{equation*}
E = 0.000170654 n^2 + 0.600313 n - 5.13889
\end{equation*}

From this formula, the histograms can be calibrated to yield a correct energy scale such as the $^{137}Cs$ spectrum in Fig.\ref{Fig:CsCalib}. These histograms can then be used for data analysis of the angular dependence of the differential cross section of Compton scattering.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering	
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{CsCalibFullSpec.png}
	\caption{}
	\label{Fig:CsCalib}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Electron Rest Mass}

Once the calibrated energy scale of the collected data is determined, the angular dependence of the kinematics of Compton Scattering can be verified by placing the detector at various angles from the beam axis of the gamma ray source. The first value to verify is the energy of the scattered photon. As previously mentioned, this energy follows the relationship defined in Eq. \ref{eq:energy_scatter}. Taking the inverse of each side orients the equation into a form that allows for more straight forward data analysis.

\begin{gather*}\label{eq:energy_scatter2}
	\frac{1}{E_\gamma '} = \frac{1}{E_\gamma} + \frac{1}{m_{e}c^{2}}(1 - cos\theta)
\end{gather*}

This form of the equation demonstrates a linear relationship between $\frac{1}{E_\gamma '}$ and $(1 - \cos\theta)$ with a slope of $\frac{1}{m_{e}c^{2}}$. Plotting the measured energy of the scattered photon as a function of the angle of the detector yields a plot similar to the one in FIG.~\ref{Fig:EScatFit}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering	
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{EScatvTheta.png}
	\caption{Plot of relationship between scattered photon energy ($E_\gamma$) and angle ($\theta$)}
	\label{Fig:EScatFit}
\end{figure}

FIG.~\ref{Fig:EScatFit} shows a linear fit applied to the experimental data (shown in red). Using the slope of this fit, the initial energy of the gamma photon was calculated to be $E_\gamma = 660.5 keV$. 

\subsection{Angular Dependence of the Scattering Probability}

\begin{gather}\label{eq:fitfunction}
	f(x) = [0]*e^{\frac{(x-[1])^2}{2*[2]^2}} + e^{[3]+[4]x} + [5]
\end{gather}

\begin{gather}\label{eq:y_theta}
	Y(\theta) = N_\gamma N_e \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}d\Omega \rightarrow \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \frac{Y(\theta)}{N_\gamma N_e d\Omega}
\end{gather}

After calibrating our detector and using that calibration to determine the electron mass, we sought to understand the angular dependence of the scattering probability for our $\gamma$-rays, or how $d \sigma / d \Omega$ changes with $\theta$. In order to do this, we placed the large Al scatterer at the pivot point of our setup and took spectra of the strong $^{137}$Cs source. We placed blocks of lead to obscure the source from the detector, so that the vast majority of $\gamma$-rays we would detect would be those which had scattered through the aluminum. We measured the resulting spectra, multiple times, at a number of angles between $0^{\circ}$ and $110^{\circ}$. Using Eq. \ref{eq:y_theta}, defined in \cite{milissinos} and \cite{manual}, we can use these spectra to relate the number of photons observed to $d\sigma / d\Omega$. At each angle, we fit the $661.6~keV$ peak to Equation \ref{eq:fitfunction} and integrated over the gaussian portion of our fit (The green curve in Figure \ref{GaussianPortion}), discarding the background photons. We then normalized each spectra for the amount of time the measurement took, as the lower angles would take only a few minutes while the higher angles would take upwards of 30.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{GaussianPortion.png}
	\caption{Plot showing the total fit (blue) and gaussian fit (green) for the spectrum of $^{137}$Cs at $\theta = 110^\circ$.}
	\label{GaussianPortion}
\end{figure}

This integral gives us our value for $Y(\theta)$. $N_\gamma$ is found in much the same way, but at $\theta = 0^\circ$ and with the scatterer absent. To obtain the value of $d\Omega$, we simply measured the area of the detector and the distance from the source to the detector. From these values, the angle subtended by the detector is simply: $d\Omega = A_{det}/r^2$. We then needed to estimate the number of electrons $N_e$ in the scatterer. For this portion of the experiment, we assume that all of the electrons in the Aluminum are free. With this assumption, the expression for $N_e$ reduces to:
\begin{gather}
	\begin{split}
		N_e 		& = \pi*\left(\frac{d_{scatter}}{2}\right)^2*h_{scatter}*\rho_{Al}*\frac{N_A}{A_{Al}}*Z_Al \\
				& = 4.29014*10^{26} \text{ electrons}
	\end{split} \nonumber
\end{gather}
\noindent Having determined all of these values, we created a plot of our experimentally determined $d\sigma / d\Omega$ vs. $\theta$, which can be seen in Figure \ref{KN} below:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{KNvsThompson_DataOnly.png}
	\caption{Data from experimental measurement of $d\sigma/d\Omega$.}
	\label{KN}
\end{figure}

\noindent At a glance, we can see that the data does not appear to exhibit the $(1 - \cos{\theta})$ dependence predicted by the Thompson formula at angles greater than $90^\circ$, and is roughly consistent with the shape predicted by the Klein-Nishina Formula. In the coming sections, we will compare this data in a more rigorous way to the results predicted by both the Thompson and Klein-Nishina Formulae

\subsection{Free Electrons in Cu and Al}

Different metals will have different number of free electrons. This depends on the relative abundance of different isotopes. Almost $100\%$ of aluminum found on earth is $^{27}$Al, while copper is $69.17 \%$ $^{63}$Cu and $30.83 \%$ $^{65}$Cu. Additionally, the metals occupy different groups of the periodic table, which effects the number of valence electrons available.

\section{Theoretical Model}

\subsection{Angular Dependence of the Scattering Probability}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{KNvsThompson_TheoryOnly.png}
	\caption{Comparison of the Theoretical Predictions for the KN and Thompson Models}
	\label{KN_vs_Thompson_Theory}
\end{figure}

Theoretically, the angular dependence of the scattering probability is given by either the Thompson Formula (Equation \ref{eq:thompson}) or the Klein-Nishina Formula (Equation \ref{eq:kn}). The theoretical predictions for $d\sigma / d\Omega$ for our particular setup is shown in Figure \ref{KN_vs_Thompson_Theory}. This plot shows that at low $\theta$, for a $661.6~keV$ $\gamma$-ray from $^{137}$Cs decay, the two Formulae converge. However, they quickly diverge as one goes to higher and higher angles. It also shows that our experiment does not exist in the classical approximation ($\gamma_{KN} \ll 1$), and we should expect to see major differences between the two theories at higher and higher angles.

\section{Comparison of Theory and Experiment}

\subsection{Angular Dependence of the Scattering Probability}

In Figure \ref{KN_vs_Thompson_Theory}, we have plotted the data taken during our measurements on top of the Klein-Nishina and Thompson curves:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{KNvsThompson_Unscaled.png}
	\caption{Comparison of the Theoretical Predictions with Experimental Data}
	\label{KN_vs_Thompson_Theory}
\end{figure}

\noindent From this plot, we can clearly see that the Klein-Nishina Formula is much more consistent with our theoretical predictions then the Thompson Formula, especially at higher angles. This is consistent with our predictions that the more advanced quantum mechanical model would win out over the classical model. In order to quantify how well these functions fit our data, we used their functional forms as a fit to our data. We found the $\chi^2$ for the two formulae under two conditions, without any additional free parameters and with the addition of an overall scaling term. The results of the $\chi^2$ minimization can be seen in Table \ref{table:chi_square} below:

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|}
			\hline
			Function & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{$\chi^2$ (No Parameters)} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{$\chi^2$ (w/ Parameters)} \\ \hline
			\textit{Thompson} & 193.964 & 2.83089 \\ \hline
			\textit{KN} & 8.54703 & 0.657192 \\ \hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Comparison of the reduced $\chi^2$ value for the two functions, with and without free parameters.}
	\label{table:chi_square}
\end{table}

\noindent Clearly, Klein-Nishina is more consistent with the data both before and after the addition of a free parameter.

\subsection{Electron Rest Mass}

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}

This experiment could be improved with a stronger and/or more collimated source.

\section{Derivation of Equation \ref{eq:energy_scatter}} \label{section:derivation}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{../plots/ComptonDiagram.png}
	\caption{Diagram showing a photon scattering off an electron at rest. Image courtesy of Wikipedia.}
\end{figure}

This formula can be described semi-classically using only conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. We approximate this interaction as a photon impacting an electron which is currently at rest. We ignore the binding energy of the electron. The conservation laws require that:

\begin{gather}
	E_\gamma + E_e = E_\gamma ' + E_e '\nonumber \\
	\mathbf{p}_\gamma = \mathbf{p}_\gamma' + \mathbf{p}_e' \nonumber
\end{gather}
Initially:
\begin{gather}
	E_e = m_e c^2 \nonumber
\end{gather}
And after the collision:
\begin{gather}
	E_e' = \sqrt{(\mathbf{p}_e' c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2} \nonumber
\end{gather}
Substituting these quantities into conservation of energy, we find:
\begin{gather}
	E_\gamma + m_e c^2 = E_\gamma' + \sqrt{(\mathbf{p}_e' c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2} \nonumber \\
	\downarrow \nonumber \\
	\mathbf{p}_e^{2'} c^2  = (E_\gamma - E_\gamma' + m_e c^2)^2 - m_e^2 c^4 \nonumber
\end{gather}
Now returning to conservation of momentum:
\begin{gather}
	\mathbf{p}_e' = \mathbf{p}_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_\gamma' \nonumber
\end{gather}
Since these momenta are vector quantities, and we are only interested in a scalar, we can take the dot product:
\begin{gather}
	p_e^{2'} = \mathbf{p}_e' \cdot \mathbf{p}_e' = p_\gamma^2 + p_\gamma^{2'} - 2 p_\gamma p_\gamma' \cos{\theta} \nonumber \\
	p_e^{2'} c^2 =  p_\gamma^2 c^2 + p_\gamma^{2'} c^2 - 2 c^2 p_\gamma p_\gamma' \cos{\theta} \nonumber \\
	p_e^{2'} c^2 = E_\gamma^2 + E_\gamma^{2'} - 2 E_\gamma E_\gamma' \cos{\theta} \nonumber
\end{gather}
We can now equate these two equations for $p_e^{2'} c^2$ and find:
\begin{gather}
	(E_\gamma - E_\gamma' + m_e c^2)^2 - m_e^2 c^4 = E_\gamma^2 + E_\gamma^{2'} - 2 E_\gamma E_\gamma' \cos{\theta} \nonumber
\end{gather}
We then complete the square and reduce this equation in order to find:
\begin{gather}
	2 m_e c^2 (E_\gamma - E_\gamma') = 2 E_\gamma E_\gamma' (1- \cos{\theta}) \nonumber
\end{gather}
Which we rearrange to arrive back at Equation \ref{eq:energy_scatter}:
\begin{gather}
	E_\gamma ' = \frac{E_\gamma}{1 + \frac{E_\gamma}{m_e c^2} (1 - \cos{\theta})} \nonumber
\end{gather}
Compton's original formulation of this equation is just another form of this equation, rearranging some terms and substituting $\lambda$ for $E_\gamma$ using the relation $E_\gamma = hc/\lambda$.
\begin{gather}
	\lambda' = \lambda + \frac{h}{m_e c} (1 - \cos{\theta}) \nonumber
\end{gather}
