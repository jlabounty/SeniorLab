\end{figure}

The apparatus used in our measurements of x-ray florescence consists primarily of two components, an electron gun and a solid state detector, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:xrf_setup}. The electron gun operates by running a current through a filament, typically made out of tungsten due to its resilience to high temperatures, in a potential. Electrons are 'boiled off' the filament (a process known as thermionic emission) and are accelerated towards the anode. Some of the electrons strike the anode, but the rest escape through the opening into a collimated beam of particles. The energy of these electrons is defined by their accelerating voltage: $E_{e^-} = qV$, while their number is defined by the current.  These electrons impact the sample and cause it to emit photons, which are then picked up by the detector. The detector is a Silicon p-i-n diode manufactured by Amptek. Photons which are incident on the detector are first met with a window made of Beryllium, which is opaque to photons whose energies are below $\approx ~1~keV$. Photons whose energies are high enough to pass through this window then deposit their energy in the sensitive volume of the detector, ionizing the silicon atoms and creating a number of electron-hole pairs in the lattice structure. A bias voltage across the diode causes these electron/holes to flow and be read into the detector as a pulse of charge, whose magnitude is directly proportional to the energy which was deposited in the detector by the photons. This pulse is passed through an amplifier, which is then passed into the multi-channel analyzer (MCA), and then from there into the computer system. From there, the information is saved in a format which can be read into our data analysis software, ROOT. This software is developed and maintained by scientists at CERN, and contains many useful fitting and histogram manipulation packages. We also performed independent cross checks of its $\chi^2$ minimization techniques, which can be found in Appendix \ref{section:root}.

\subsection{X-Ray Diffraction}

\end{figure}

This experiment consists of three primary components: the x-ray source, the goniometer, and the detector. The x-ray source uses the same method of x-ray production as the setup detailed above. However, instead of switching the samples out to change the characteristic x-rays of the system, here the target sample for the electrons is kept constant, and is composed of copper. This means that the characteristic x-rays we expect to see are those produced by copper: $K_\alpha = 8037.8 ~eV= 0.154358 ~nm$ and $K_\beta = 8905.29 ~eV = 0.139322 ~nm$. These x-rays are collimated by sheets of lead with small openings and then allowed to stream freely towards the sample. The second portion of the experiment is the goniometer, which keeps the relative angle of the sample and the detector constant: $\theta_{\text{detector}} = 2\theta_{\text{sample}}$ (relative to $\theta = 0$ defined by the path of the undiffracted x-rays). The x-rays which are diffracted off of the sample then enter the detector. This detector differs from the previous version in that it is

\subsubsection{Characterization of the Detector}

Before performing an analysis of x-ray fluorescence, we had to calibrate the energy scale of the MCA to determine the conversion between the channel number ($n$) of a detected photon and its energy. In order to perform this calibration, x-ray fluorescence spectra were collected for various samples with known energy peaks. Fig.~\ref{} displays an example spectrum with fitted peaks.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{EvsBin.png}
	\caption{Energy vs Channel Number Calibration Plot}
	\label{Fig:Evsbin}
\end{figure}

Each peak on one of these spectra was fit with a Gaussian distribution to find the mean value of the peak. This mean value was stored as the bin number corresponding to the peak of known energy provided by external sources. We collected corresponding energies and bin numbers for several samples of different elements to generate the energy vs bin number plot in Fig.~\ref{Fig:Evsbin}.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{EvsBin.png}
	\caption{Energy vs Channel Number Calibration Plot}
	\label{Fig:Evsbin}
\end{figure}

The linear fit on this plot provided us with the energy calibration in Eq.~\ref{eq:ECalib}.
\begin{gather}\label{eq:ECalib}
E = 0.0245644n - 0.0545754
\end{gather}

With this calibration, we could then calculate the energies of peaks in our x-ray fluorescence spectra.

\section{Validation of the $\chi^2$ Minimization in ROOT} \label{section:root}
For this experiment, we used ROOT, a c++ based data analysis software, to plot and fit functions to our data. To verify that ROOT calculates a correct value for $\chi^{2}$, we performed a hand calculation cross check with a simple set of data. The data set we used for this cross check was $\{ (11.0 \pm 0.0, 23.0 \pm 0.5), (14.0 \pm 0.0, 25.0 \pm 0.5), (20.0 \pm 0.0, 35.0 \pm 0.5), (25.0 \pm 0.0, 39.0 \pm 0.5) \}$. We plotted this data and fit it to a linear function $f(x) = [0] + [1]*x$. This plot is shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:rootproof}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{rootproof.png}
	\caption{Sample Data Fitted to a Line}
	\label{Fig:rootproof}
\end{figure}
The function obtained from this fit was $f(x) = 9.11111 + 1.22222x$ with a chi-squared of $\chi ^{2} = 16.8889$. We then performed a hand calculation of the $\chi ^{2}$ using Eq.~\ref{eq:chisq}.
\begin{gather}\label{eq:chisq}
\chi ^{2} = \sum \frac{(f(x_i) - y_i)^{2}}{\sigma_i^2}
\end{gather}
When performing this hand calculation we also obtained a value of $\chi ^{2} = 16.8889$, verifying ROOT's ability to calculate $\chi ^{2}$.
\begin{align*}
\chi ^{2} =& \frac{(f(11.0) - 23.0)^{2}}{(0.5)^2} + \frac{(f(14.0) - 25.0)^{2}}{(0.5)^2} \\
&+ \frac{(f(20.0) - 35.0)^2}{(0.5)^2} + \frac{(f(25.0) - 39.0)^{2}}{(0.5)^2} \\
&= 16.8889
\end{align*}
